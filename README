Bioconductor is a rich repository of bioinformatics software packages for the R programming language, primarily focused on the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. Some major R and Bioconductor packages include:
	DESeq2: Used for differential gene expression analysis.
	limma: Employs linear models for microarray data analysis.
	edgeR: Popular for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.
	tidyverse: A collection of packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr) that share common principles for data manipulation and visualization.
	caret: A comprehensive package for training and evaluating predictive models.
	randomForest: Implements random forest algorithms for classification and regression.
	PCAtools: Offers a suite of functions for PCA analysis and visualization.
	ggplot2: A powerful and flexible package for creating static and interactive data visualizations.
